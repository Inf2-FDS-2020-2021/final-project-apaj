During this project, the work was divided equally among the two of us.
- Initially, we both contributed to the main direction we wanted the project to take. We
unanimously agreed on the third option.
- Alessandro suggested a bubble chart to compare the activty at stations in the pre and post
lockdown periods. Afterwhich, I suggested the use of 
an A/B test comparing the proportion of 'long trips' as our second investigative question. 
- Before starting, we met to discuss the key dates that we would consider in identifying the
pre and post pandemic periods. Both of us were responsible for this.
- Alessandro was responsible for the data preprocessing, data exploration and the generating the 
statistical findings.
- I was responsible for generating the visualisations and making sure that they were visually
appealing and were aligned with the general best practices for visualisations.
- I was responsible for the writing of the report.
- Alessandro and I were both responsible in correcting mistakes, both logical and grammatical,
in the report.
