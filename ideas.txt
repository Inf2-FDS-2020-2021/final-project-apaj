- Null hypothesis and confidence intervals to see if the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic rentals were any different.
- Length of trips increased ?
	- Was it a leisure activity or did people use the bikes for commuting. 
- University student influx affect on the bikes
- Difference between trips on weekends and weekdays.
- Seasonal effects
- Weather
- Night time rides with relevance to Covid-19 restrictions.
- Lockdown rule breakers ? ;)
