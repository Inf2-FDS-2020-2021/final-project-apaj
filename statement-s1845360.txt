How work was divided and contributions made:
* First off it's important to note that the entire study was a team effort. Most coding
  and all of the write up was done when we were on a call together.
* Both Andrej and I took part in an initial brainstorming session to raise potential
  interesting questions. 
* I wrote the code for downloading the data and processing it all into the data sets we would go 
  on to use. 
* I then explored the data sets to try answer as many of our initial questions we raised to
  find out which ones were relevant and plotted them in their most basic forms for exploratory
  means only. 
* Andrej turned the graphs we decided to go forward with into visually appealing forms.
* When it came to the main report I helped in outlining the main points with Andrej as he wrote
  up all the finalised text.
